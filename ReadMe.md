# FLG Coding Challenge (birthdays-frontend)

## Setup

Clone this repository to a local directory and setup with:

```
 >  npm install
```

To run unit tests:

```
 > npm test
```

## Functionality

This displays a single page with a list of birthdays.
It is pre-populated with some test people and birthdays
but more may be added.

The full list of birthdays is toggled by clicking on the 'View all birthdays'/ 'Hide all birthdays' button.
Birthdays may be deleted by clicking on their delete button
Birthdays may be added by using the input fields and Add button at the bottom.

## Note
Please be aware that this is a very quickly coded app concentrating on the functionality, rather than presenting
a beautiful front-end.

It was developed using TDD so all of the methods are tested with Jest.
